# advent_of_code_rust
My answers to advent of code(of course in rust)

As of right now it is really a mess and I don't have time to clean it up. I will do it asap.

Why mess? Well I was just doing aoc 4fun and then I remembered I have a github so I thoiught that I can publish it. I published it and remembered that the code is an absolute abomination so I will have fun later cleaning it up.
